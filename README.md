In this project, there are three different files in it:-
        *grade-Generator.js
        *speed-detector.js
        *net_calculator.js
the main goal of this project is to make sure that we are able to understand the basics of javascript and how to implement them.

## Description
This project contains three different files in it that are expected to excute defferent task and function.
    
The grade-Generator file contains code that will be used to create a grading system that returns the grade result as to which the marks are
assigned. For instance  when 90 is typed as the mark the systen retuns a grade 0f an "A" and so on. thwe range in this system is between  0 - 100, any other nuver or value is referred as invalid.

Speed-detector.js contains code that will be used to to return whether the driver is driving over the speed and returns the demerit points for the speed over the the set speed limit. If the speed beats 12 demerit points the results returned is eaqual to license suspended with the amunt of demerits point above the speed limit.

Net_calculator.js contains code that will be used to calculate the Net pay.
This is achieved by being able to create functions that calculates Kra, Nssf,Nhif deductions from the gross pay. In order to craete this code you need to know that (netpay = gross pay +benefits -(all deducions i.e. NSSF + NHIF + KRA)).
